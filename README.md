- REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop

* A variable is simply the name of a storage location.
* Data types
  - Numbers
  - String
  - NaN
  - Boolean
* The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number. The NaN is a number but the value it
  represents is not a number.

* Operator Precedence - (), \*_, _,/,%(all are same level, go from left to right) +,-(LtoR)
* We use **let** keyword to declare variable.
* value of constants can't be changed with re-assignment and they can't be redeclared.
  We declare constant using **const** keyword.
* **var** keyword is used to declare a variable, this is a old syntax of writing variables.
* Pre-increment: Change the variable value and then use.
* post-increment: use the variable value and then change.

* Identifier Rules

  - All javascript variables must be identified with unique names(identifier)
  - Names can contain letter, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.(no space)
  - Names must begin with a letter.
  - Names can also begin with $ and \_ .
  - Names are case sensitive(y and Y are different variables.)
  - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.

* camelCase (JS naming convention)
* snake_case
  \*PascalCase

* TypeScript is static typed, where JS is dynamic typed.
* Strings are text or sequece of characters. Strings can be written in double quotes are single quotes.
* index = position. JS is 0 based indexing programming language.

* Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
* null : The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value. To be explicitly assigned.
